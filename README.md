# WebApp
The Weather WebApp displays weather information such as the current temperature, forecasted highs and lows, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data. It also include features such as the ability to search for weather information by location, view a weekly or daily forecast, and receive alerts for severe weather conditions.

The app can be accessed through a web browser on a desktop or mobile device, and the user interface should be user-friendly and intuitive for the user to navigate. Overall, a weather web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a useful tool for staying informed about the weather and staying prepared for changing conditions.

The index.html file is the main HTML file for a Weather Web App. It usually contains the structure and content for the web page, including the header, footer, and body of the page, index.html file contains elements such as a search bar for the user to input a location, a div for displaying the current weather conditions, and perhaps a forecast for the next few days. The file also includes links to other files such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript scripts that are used to enhance the user experience or provide additional functionality to the app.

A style.css file is a stylesheet that specifies the layout and formatting of a web page written in HTML or other markup language. It is a separate file that is linked to a web page and contains all of the styles and formatting  rules for the layout and of the app's user interface, including elements such as the font, color, and size of text, the placement and appearance of buttons and other interactive elements, and the overall design of the app. By separating the style rules from the content of the web page, the style.css file makes it easier to maintain and update the design of the app without having to make changes to the underlying HTML code.

The script.js file is a JavaScript file that is used to provide additional functionality to a Weather Web App. It is linked to from the index.html file and is executed by the web browser when the page is loaded.The script.js file contains functions for making API calls to a weather service to retrieve data about the current weather conditions and forecast for a given location,also contains functions for handling user input, such as when the user submits a location for which they want to see the weather. Additionally, the script.js file also include the  code for updating the DOM (Document Object Model) with the data retrieved from the API, in order to display the weather information to the user.
